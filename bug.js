This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to access the data before it has been fully retrieved.  It's often masked by the asynchronous nature of the calls, leading to seemingly random crashes or unexpected behavior. The problem stems from attempting to use a value that's still `undefined` or `null` because the `AsyncStorage.getItem` call hasn't completed yet.  This is especially problematic when dealing with conditional rendering or updating UI elements based on this data.

```javascript
// buggy code
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then((value) => {
  this.setState({ myData: value });
});

// ... later in render function ...
<Text>{this.state.myData.someProperty}</Text>
```
